# Gradient Token Tutorial

This repo is an example for series of article on [my blog](http://maksimivanov.com) about non-fungible token, where we were doing CryptoKitties clone.

The exapmle is greatly simplified and we don't have genetic algorythms or any algorythms for breeding.

## How To Run

Run `yarn install` and then `truffle test` to run the tests.
